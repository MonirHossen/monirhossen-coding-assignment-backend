## About This Project

This is a Product and Category Add List Project. In this project, I use the Lastest Laravel 10 framework. for authentication, I use Laravel Santum. Here users can register and Login using API  based on requirements.


## Project Setup
First, you need to clone this repository
composer update 

Then make a .env 

Then run this command
```
php artisan key:generate
```

Then run this command
```
php artisan migrate
```
Or you can use the DB that I provide

Then run this command
```
php artisan serve
```

Now you have to use Postman to check my APIs

I think now this project will be run on your local machine.
Thank You!
